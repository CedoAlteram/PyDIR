# PyDIR
This pyton script allows the user to track an object using CCV (computer vision)
and translate that into a 360 degree direction of travel. 

This project prequires TUIO or CCV and port 3333 for UDP to be open.  
initiate with 
python example1.py

Notes:
Direction will remain constant every time the object appears on the screen. 


TODO:
Unique IDs can be easily be logged to a SQLite database.
